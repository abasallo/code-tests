# Pi Challenge - Angular 2

Angular 2 front for Pi Challenge code test (wording should be in the same directory as this file, same name, PDF extension).

Production build is deployed in http://pi.basallo.es

## Notes to the reviewer

Everything, except for the highchart's option object JSON representation, is included in the model.

Those JSON can be found in /src/app/services/data; the first four are used to build the initial data included.

The default column number for the dashboard is 2 and the first chart is using the whole width, while the others the minimum.

The last one is offered as a default in the element creation dialog JSON input field.

The "Service" included in /src/app/services/ is simulating what, in a real with backend app, would be that traffic.

Initial data is provided from the mentioned files and on change, all linked components update state.

This should be, of course, a full fledged JSON enabled service in a real app, communicating with the backend that, for this exercise purposes, does not exists.
