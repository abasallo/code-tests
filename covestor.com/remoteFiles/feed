				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/xavier-bremner" title="Xavier Brenner">Xavier Brenner</a></p>
<p>Bill Gross’s dramatic exit from the investment firm Pacific Investment Management Co. (Pimco) for Janus Capital Group (<a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/jns">JNS</a>) has led some to conclude the era of the superstar fund manager is finished.</p>
<p>At its peak, the Pimco Total Return Fund that Gross managed held $293 billion in assets back in early 2013. Now he’s gone. His departure offers up <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/10/3-lessons-investors-bill-gross-exits-pimco">useful lessons</a> about the cult of star mutual-fund manager.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40905" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/when-to-fire-your-mutual-fund-manager.jpg" alt="when-to-fire-your-mutual-fund-manager" width="450" height="338" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what should you do when you’re concerned your fund manager has lost his or her touch? Maybe you’ve noticed your fund has been consistently underperforming its benchmark. But breaking up can be hard to do, especially if there are tax consequences for selling.</p>
<p>When is it time to sack your manager? Here are three potential signs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>1) Long-term performance is inconsistent and slipping</b></h3>
<p>You shouldn’t freak out if your manager is lagging an appropriate index for shorter time periods, such as monthly or quarterly. In fact, it can be counterproductive to obsessively check your portfolio.</p>
<p>Yet, remember, performance is the ultimate benchmark here. <i>(See what our director of client relations thinks about </i><a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/right-way-wrong-way-use-past-performance"><i>how to use past performance</i></a><i>.)</i></p>
<p>If your manager is consistently underperforming the market during the good years and getting crushed during the bad ones, there could be a problem. Ignoring it could be costly to your personal wealth.</p>
<p>It could be time to make a move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>2) Overconfidence</b></h3>
<p>Good managers exude confidence. They’ve developed a time-tested investment approach that has delivered consistent returns. Smart managers also react quickly to mistakes before they mushroom into full-blown disasters.</p>
<p>Most active managers stick to established asset allocation guidelines and report to investment committees. Beware of fund managers, though, who think they are the LeBron James of investing.</p>
<p>These managers can end up having a lot of autonomy, with few checks and balances. They may also resist admitting a mistake, taking the loss, and moving on.</p>
<p>Confidence can sometimes turn into arrogance. And that could lead to trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>3) Fees are too high</b></h3>
<p>Fees are understandably a controversial subject, and even more so with the rise of low-cost index funds and ETFs.</p>
<p>Active managers who deliver the goods can be worth their fees. Just remember that higher fees act as a drag on returns, and raise the bar for the manager to outperform.</p>
<p>And if you use a financial adviser or broker, be careful of being put into funds that charge commissions and sales fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The decision to fire your mutual fund manager is an important one and shouldn’t be taken lightly.</strong> However, there are times when it just makes sense to show them the door.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/eqm-capital" title="Jane Edmondson">Jane Edmondson</a></p>
<p>The third quarter of 2014 had its shares of ups and downs. <strong>Much of the market volatility was geopolitically driven this quarter with Russia, Scotland, and ISIS taking turns spooking the capital markets.</strong></p>
<p>Here in the U.S., there were mixed economic signals leading investors to wonder when Janet Yellen’s Federal Reserve will sound the “all clear” signal for the domestic economy and start to increase interest rates. The <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Index/MLO?countrycode=XX" target="_blank">jobs picture</a> looks vastly improved with the unemployment rate dipping to 5.9%.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40899" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/investing-in-a-goldilocks-economy.jpg" alt="investing-in-a-goldilocks-economy" width="450" height="253" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Strong dollar</h3>
<p>But wage growth is still not impressive, contributing to weakness in areas like housing and discretionary spending.  As a result, the Fed intends to wait a “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-17/fed-keeps-considerable-time-pledge-as-growth-is-moderate-.html" target="_blank">considerable time</a>” before it raises interest rates.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 Index climbed 0.6% in the quarter, setting new highs along the way. However, the quarter did not exactly end on a positive note, with the S&amp;P 500 declining 1.6% in September, and off 4.6% from the record high it set on September 19th.</p>
<p>One reason for the market decline was the strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other global currencies. <strong>Investors are concerned that U.S. companies and their corporate earnings growth will be negatively impacted by a stronger dollar overseas.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_40889" style="width: 473px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-40889" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/EQM-1-.png" alt="US-Dollar" width="463" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click to Enlarge</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, one residual effect of a stronger dollar is the driving down of dollar-denominated oil prices. This is a positive for industries and sectors where <strong>oil is a major input in the cost of production</strong>.</p>
<p>And to the extent that lower oil prices translate into lower prices at the gas pump, this is ultimately a good thing for the consumer in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_40890" style="width: 477px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-40890" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/EQM-2.png" alt="oil-price-drops" width="467" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click to Enlarge</p></div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Just right?</h3>
<p>So the question going into the end of the year is this: Will economic strength at home offset weakness abroad? And as we approach earnings season in this Goldilocks economy, are current earnings expectations too hot, too cold, or just right?</p>
<p>Mid-cap stocks remained at the middle of the pack in the third quarter, holding up better than small caps which are now near correction territory off almost 10% their July 3rd highs.</p>
<p>But mid caps did not keep pace with large caps, as investors remain more cautious, favoring size, quality, and liquidity. Mid Cap Value outperformed Mid Cap Growth.</p>
<p>One of the top-performing names for the <a href="http://covestor.com/eqm-capital/mid-cap-quant">EQM Capital MidCap Quant portfolio </a>in Q3 was specialty pharma company Salix Pharmaceuticals <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/slxp">(SLXP)</a>. Salix Pharmaceuticals has a desirable GI drug franchise and has been a rumored takeover candidate.</p>
<p>Another top contributor was athletic apparel maker Under Armour <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/ua">(UA)</a>. The company continues to execute well and posted strong earnings results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Buying opportunity</h3>
<p>Retail names like apparel and handbag company Kate Spade <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/kate">(KATE) </a>and Zebra Technologies <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/zbra">(ZBRA)</a>, which makes barcode scanners, detracted from relative performance during the quarter.</p>
<p>Kate Spade was sold toward the end of September in favor of biopharmaceutical stock Medivation <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/mdvn">(MDVN)</a>, which has a promising new drug (<a href="https://www.xtandihcp.com/" target="_blank">Xtandi</a>) to treat prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Our stock selection process continues to identify growth stocks in the mid-cap segment trading at reasonable multiples. And with all the uncertainty out there going into the end of the year, the middle ground seems like a good place to fish for good opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/crabtree-asset-management" title="Barry Randall">Barry Randall</a></p>
<p>GT Advanced Technologies <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/gtat">(GTAT)</a> filed for bankruptcy on Monday and its stock proceeded to lose about 90% of its value.</p>
<p>There are several lessons that tech investors can take away from the news.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40895" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/barbed-wire-420503_640.jpg" alt="gtat-bankruptcy-fallout" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll get to a discussion about GT and its failings in a moment. But right now, I’d like you to know three things:</p>
<p>1)    I don’t own GT Advanced Technology shares in the Crabtree Technology portfolio.</p>
<p>2)    I’ve never owned GT Advanced Technology shares in the portfolio.</p>
<p>3)    There are three reasons why it would be unlikely that a company like GT would find its way into the portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>GT Advanced Technology is a New Hampshire-based company that develops and sells equipment that is, in turn, used to manufacture silicon, polysilicon (the underlying material in solar cells) and synthetic sapphire.</strong> Founded in 1994, GT recorded revenue over the past 12 months of more than $150 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Business unraveled</h3>
<p>In late 2013, GT signed an agreement with Apple <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/aapl">(AAPL) </a>to outfit an Arizona factory with GT Advanced Technology’s equipment for the production of sapphire. After completion, the factory would be run by GT.</p>
<p>While unreported at the time, the plan was for the factory to produce sapphire for the clear touchscreens on Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for both parties, the prototype sapphire screens produced in the factory and provided to Apple didn’t have the desired attributes (better scratch resistance, in particular) the companies had been hoping for.</p>
<p>The new iPhones were released in September with screens from Apple’s existing supplier Corning <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/glw">(GLW)</a> and Apple recently withheld a payment to GT. <strong>The now heavily indebted GT, lessee of a plant with no customers for its products, filed Chapter 11.</strong></p>
<p>When I read the headlines about GT, I immediately looked at my quantitative model to see how well it scored. Or, in this case, didn’t score. First off, GT shares were trading at a price: sales ratio of about 10. Our hurdle is much, much lower – less than 25% of that. <strong>So it failed to pass our quant model for that reason alone.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Earnings misses</h3>
<p>We don’t use a valuation hurdle for valuation; we’re not value investors. Rather, we use valuation as a proxy for fame. That’s because all things being equal, <a href="http://crabtree-am.com/wp-content/themes/crabtree-am/pdf/Fang%20Peress%20Media%20and%20Returns%20031809.pdf">less famous companies outperform</a> more famous companies. And with the luster from its association with Apple, GT was plenty famous.</p>
<p>Second, I noticed that <strong>GT had fallen short of earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters.</strong> We use this measurement as a report card on how well companies are executing on their operational and financial goals.</p>
<p>By itself, earnings ‘beats’ or ‘misses’ don’t say a lot. But when combined with other factors, like a company’s cash flow, it’s a strong indicator to us of how well a company can execute in the future.</p>
<p>And speaking of cash flow, I noticed that in my most recent model, GT had negative operating cash flow over the last year, and negative free cash flow over that time as well. Our investors and regular readers know that we’re really big on a company’s ability to generate cash.</p>
<p>Cash is the lifeblood of business. And we believe current cash flow is the strongest predictor of future cash flow. All companies selected for the Crabtree Technology model have positive operating cash flow over their most recent 12 months.</p>
<p>At Crabtree, we place a very high emphasis on keeping portfolio volatility low and that means foregoing exciting stocks with sexy stories and high profile partners (example: Apple) when they don’t meet our standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Risk capital</h3>
<p>Make no mistake: no stock in the Crabtree Technology portfolio is perfect or is immune from under-performing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the news of a GT-type blow-up will affect the share prices of other, similar stocks, even the shares of companies that are performing well and in no apparent danger of a shocking development like GT’s bankruptcy. <strong>This is the stock market, after all. People are investing risk capital. We never forget that.</strong></p>
<p>September was mixed for the <a href="http://covestor.com/crabtree-asset-management/crabtree-technology">Crabtree Technology portfolio</a>. The portfolio fell 2.5% in the month, much better than the 6.2% decline in the Russell 2000 Index <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Index/RUT?countrycode=US" target="_blank">(RUT)</a> but trailing slightly the -1.6% decline in the S&amp;P 500 <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Index/SPX?countrycode=US" target="_blank">(SPX) </a>benchmark.</p>
<p>Our internal benchmark, the Merrill Lynch Technology 100 <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Index/MLO?countrycode=XX" target="_blank">(MLO) </a>also fell 2.5% in September. The most widely held technology ETF, the State Street Global Advisors’ Technology Select SPDR <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/symbol/xlk">(XLK)</a> fell -0.5% during the month, including the effect of a dividend.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/peattie-capital" title="Bill Peattie">Bill Peattie</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for a little perspective.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a runaway spike in rates (at least not now). <strong>So, here&#8217;s why you should stop worrying about U.S. monetary policy.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40868" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/investing-with-rising-interest-rates.jpg" alt="investing-with-rising-interest-rates" width="450" height="297" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The (roughly) 2.4% yield on the US 10-year note is higher than most developed countries&#8217; yield and for the time being will continue to attract global funds.</p>
<h3>Chill out</h3>
<p>Look at some bond yields around the world: Germany 1%, Japan 0.5%, France 1.3%, and the United Kingdom 2.4%.</p>
<p>Which would you rather buy, a U.S. 10-year note yielding 2.5% or an Italian note at 2.3%?</p>
<p>In addition, the <strong>U.S. economy remains on a slow but steady growth trajectory</strong>, although recent data has been a bit more mixed. <strong>Other global economies are struggling</strong>, and <strong>inflation is below the Fed&#8217;s stated 2% target.</strong></p>
<p>Given these factors, I just don&#8217;t see the reasoning behind an accelerated rise in rates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said repeatedly that a 5%-10% correction would be normal and healthy. <strong>However, every time the market drops 2% to 3% buyers come in and the market subsequently rallies to a new high.</strong></p>
<p>While the late September/early October sell-off was real, the latest <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/business/economy/monthly-jobs-report-september.html?_r=0" target="_blank">jobs report</a> for September supports the &#8220;steady U.S. economy&#8221; theory.</p>
<p>Ebola, ISIS, Ukraine, and other global headlines do not drive long-term investment success, but they do make for attention-grabbing headlines. I&#8217;m much more interested in the interplay of valuation, liquidity and sentiment.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Small cap rebound</h3>
<p>And with the exception of sentiment (which had gotten too frothy) these &#8220;legs of the stool&#8221; continue to suggest a favorable environment for equities.</p>
<p>Three times in 2014 (in February, May, and now September) the Russell 2000 small cap index has dropped to the 1090 level, and each time it has subsequently bounced back.</p>
<p>In addition, according to this week&#8217;s Barron&#8217;s, in the <a href="http://online.barrons.com/news/articles/SB51517841841143733463604580192340745033582" target="_blank">17 midterm election </a>years since 1946, the S&amp;P 500 has delivered a positive return, averaging 17.5% for the twelve months measured from October 31 of the midterm year to the following October 31st.</p>
<p>While neither of these factoids guarantees the same results again, I like the odds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In September, I&#8217;m afraid that I was  woefully out of sync with the market&#8217;s whipsaw action.</p>
<p>My stock picks were quite good, but unfortunately I seem to have gotten in and out of my positions at the wrong times.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40865" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/investing-on-wall-street.jpg" alt="investing-on-wall-street" width="450" height="338" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Aging Bull</h3>
<p>September definitely had is share of <strong>frustrating</strong> moments.</p>
<p>I always try to learn from my mistakes, so I&#8217;m going to begin getting in and out of my stocks only when they cross 30- or 60-day moving averages.</p>
<p><strong>This bull market is in my opinion getting a little long in the tooth</strong>, so I&#8217;m trying to position myself for a downturn. At this point I&#8217;m only partially invested in equities while leaving roughly 40% in cash.</p>
<p><strong>In my opinion, the two stocks that I presently own, Inovio <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/ino">(INO)</a> and Neuralstem <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/cur">(CUR)</a>, will be affected less by the movement of the market as a whole</strong> and more by the success or failure of drugs they have in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Obviously these are gambles, but in my opinion they&#8217;re good gambles with a terrific potential upside.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/sparrow-capital" title="Gerry Sparrow">Gerry Sparrow</a></p>
<p>U.S. small-cap stocks have been notably weak recently and I believe some of the market volatility is due to<strong> y the Federal Reserve’s conservative posture with respect to interest rates and the cutting back of bond buying activities</strong>.</p>
<p>Although October has a <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/4-things-know-investing-october">bad reputation with investors</a>, since 1950, markets often improve between the third week of October through April the following year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40836" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/Time-to-Buy.png" alt="Time-to-buy" width="450" height="402" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on these historical trends, this may be a good time to invest in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Gas pump relief</h3>
<p>I continue to be overweight stocks versus bonds because I believe most of the slowdown in economic activity has passed as lower energy prices provide consumer relief at the gas pump.</p>
<p>Car buying and home purchases remain strong and though I have no way of knowing for sure this may help the markets next year.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I continue to believe third quarter earnings will be solid and may be a catalyst to move the markets higher before the end of 2014.</p>
<p>My investment approach with the <a href="http://covestor.com/sparrow-capital/fundamental-growth">Covestor Fundamental Growth portfolio </a>is to buy companies with consistent earning power, high return-on-equity while employing little or no long-term debt and to purchase at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>I have a system that filters thousands of stocks on a weekly basis using the Sparrow multi-point checklist that screens the highest quality companies, which are then reviewed and considered for purchase in the portfolio.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/banu-simmons" title="Banu Simmons">Banu Simmons</a></p>
<p>In <a href="http://covestor.com/banu-simmons">previous reports</a>, I have argued that the <strong>U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates until the first quarter of 2015</strong>. Although an interest rate increase may lead to a temporary sell-off in the markets, historically the impact is not as bad as it is feared.</p>
<p>In order to analyze the effect of an interest rate increase on stock returns, I recently carried out regression analysis at the sector level using monthly data for the period of 1992 through 2014.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40827" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/Janet-Yellen.png" alt="U.S.-Federal-Reserve-Yellen" width="450" height="320" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I analyzed the stock returns of different industries after a change in the benchmark Federal Fund Rate with an adjustment for market capitalization and book-value differences.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what may happen after U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen really turns off the money presses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>By the numbers</h3>
<p><strong>According to my research, only a few sectors show major sensitivity to rate increases: Among them are building materials, chemicals, and personal household products.</strong></p>
<p>Most industrial, electrical engineering and IT stocks are not negatively affected, with the exception of semiconductors.</p>
<p>In fact, the stock returns of financial services are positively related to rate increases, presumably because the earnings outlook of these stocks are largely driven by the strength of the economy which more than offsets any negative impact of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>By the same token, <strong>the returns of anti-cyclical stocks react negatively to a rate increase</strong>. Higher interest rates are associated with a strong economy, which puts a damper on the performance of such defensive stocks.</p>
<p>As far as the impact of the strong US dollar is concerned, I believe that any negative impact on the profits of the US companies is likely to be small.</p>
<p>The US economy is generally not very export-driven and the major destinations for the US exports are Mexico and Canada rather than the Eurozone.</p>
<p>According to the US Census Bureau statistics, the share of the whole European Union in the US exports is 16.6% (Canada 19.1%, Mexico 14.3%).</p>
<p>Therefore, going forward, the negative export effect from the European Union may have a limited effect, especially if possibly forthcoming monetary stimulus revives the European demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Market overview</h3>
<p>As the summer holiday season ended, stock markets turned bearish. September was a volatile month with the S&amp;P 500 recording a 1.6% decline.</p>
<p>Implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 as measured by the CBOE’s Volatility Index <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/vix">(VIX)</a> rose 34% in September, but still remains below its historical average.</p>
<p>The U.S.’s military action against ISIS, falling commodity prices caused by weak demand and excess supply, continuing conflict in Ukraine, coupled with the concerns about a possible move by Fed to increase the interest rates as early as the first quarter of 2015, spooked the markets.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar gained against most currencies and the dollar index reached a four-year high. There was also some meltdown of the IT stocks spurred by some technical issues concerning Apple‘s <a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/aapl">(APPL) </a>iPhones.</p>
<p>To add oil to the fire, the latest unrest in Hong Kong has been taking its toll especially on China-related stocks. On a more positive note, the “No” result from the Scottish referendum was well received by the markets.</p>
<p>In September, we chose not to trade given that the bearish sentiment in the markets was mainly driven by external factors than the US economic fundamentals. Being a medium to long-term investor, political unrest aside, we expect that the strength of the US economy  should continue supporting  company earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Despite remaining cautious about the possibility of a global slowdown, in my opinion the short-term market sell-offs are buying opportunity for a number of number of stocks with good long-term growth prospects.</strong></p>
<p>Looking ahead, the recent sell-off in energy stocks, caused by the falling oil price may soon reach its bottom, as it is likely that OPEC may cut its output in the face of weak global demand.</p>
<p>In my opinion, major quantitative easing measures by the European Central Bank might be underway, given that the Euro zone inflation remains extremely low. On top of that, even Germany, supposedly one of the strong economies of  the Euro zone has been showing the early signs of a slowdown.</p>
<p>A monetary stimulus by the ECB  should support the demand for commodities, and in coming months, the price of oil may rise slowly in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/author/sizemore-capital" title="Charles Sizemore">Charles Sizemore</a></p>
<p>Last month, I asked if we should have expected a “<a href="http://charlessizemore.com/september-2014-portfolio-outlook-fear-september-swoon/" target="_blank">September swoon</a>.” Well, as it would turn out, we did—but not in U.S. large-cap stocks.</p>
<p>It was emerging markets that took the biggest beating—<b>Brazilian stocks, in particular, lost over 20% of their value</b>—though yield-sensitive investments such as REITs, mortgage REITs, and high-dividend-yielding stocks also took a major hit.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40813" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/brazil-123665_640.jpg" alt="brazil-emerging-markets" width="450" height="338" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s the story here?</p>
<h3>Perfect storm</h3>
<p>It was a nasty combination of events. The Fed indicated that short-term rates may be rising faster than previously thought, Brazil’s presidential election appears to be shifting in favor of the anti-market incumbent, and the <a href="http://charlessizemore.com/stocktwits-banter-reactions-bill-gross-departure/" target="_blank">sudden departure of “Bond King” Bill Gross</a> destabilized the bond market.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here?</p>
<p>For now, I am remaining mostly—though not fully—invested. In my most speculative portfolio—<a href="http://covestor.com/sizemore-capital/tactical-etf">Tactical ETF</a>—I raised a modest amount of cash.</p>
<p>But the portfolio remains heavily invested in the markets that I believe offer the best potential for explosive growth over the next 6-12 months—including Brazil, Russia and China. (See “<a href="http://charlessizemore.com/brazil-worlds-greatest-value-right-now/" target="_blank">Brazil: The World’s Greatest Value Right Now?</a>”.)</p>
<p>The market is clearly very concerned that a more hawkish Federal Reserve will effectively pull liquidity out of emerging markets. I’m far less convinced. In my opinion, investors have been dumping emerging market stocks and currencies for the better part of four years, so at the margin it’s difficult to see how the Fed’s <i>very</i> modest tightening will be much of a game changer.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>The sequel</h3>
<p><b>In my view, the September selloff in emerging markets is simply a repeat of the selloff we saw in January and comes after an eight-month run in which emerging markets as an asset class performed very well.</b></p>
<p>My other major speculative play in the Tactical ETF portfolio is in mortgage REITs. I have a 15% allocation to the <b>UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2X Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN </b><a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/morl">(MORL)</a>.</p>
<p>Mortgage REITs have been absolutely pummeled since the start of September, down about 8% as a sector, not including dividends.  And as a leveraged fund, MORL has taken an even greater beating.</p>
<p>But as I wrote in a <a href="http://charlessizemore.com/macro-trend-investor-comprehensive-portfolio-review/">recent post</a>, mortgage REITs are now cheap, trading below book value.  MORL’s underlying REITs are trading at a weighted average of 97 cents on the dollar and a yield of 11%.  (Applying leverage gives MORL a yield of about 22%).</p>
<p>If the Fed raises rates earlier than hoped—or if long-term yields drift lower—could dividends be cut?  Absolutely in my opinion.  But in buying these REITs below book value, our risk is very tolerable.</p>
<p>Rising long-term bond yields would depress book values, which—all else equal—should lead to a sell-off of mortgage REITs. But how high are yields likely to go?  And how much of an increase has already been priced in by the past month’s declines in mortgage REIT prices?</p>
<p>I’ve consistently made my case throughout 2014 that bond yields are likely to fluctuate in a fairly tight range over the next several years.  (I expect to see the 10-year Treasury yield bouncing in a range of about 2.2% to 3.2% with an average around 2.6%.)</p>
<p>Fed tightening—to the extent it happens at all—will depend on economic data continuing to come in strongly. Thus far, the data has been mixed at best, and we should remember that we are now more than five years into the current economic expansion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nothing is forever</h3>
<p>I’m not forecasting an imminent recession, but in the entire span of U.S. history since the Great Depression the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States">longest stretch we’ve ever gone without a recession was 10 years</a>—and that was during the 1990s tech boom. Since the Great Depression, the average time between recessions was four years and nine months.</p>
<p>Again, I’m not necessarily predicting a recession around the corner. But expansions do not last forever, and we should remember that our current expansion has been aided by record federal deficits and the loosest monetary policy in U.S. history.</p>
<p><b>I think it’s highly likely that we will indeed see a recession at some point in the next two years.</b></p>
<p>Why does this matter?  Because bond yields tend to fall in recessions. We should also remember that, with yields in Japan and Europe hovering near all-time lows, demand for U.S. Treasuries should keep a tight yield on Treasuries for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Bottom line: The fourth quarter is getting off to a rocky start. <strong>But in my opinion it makes sense to stay the course in both mortgage REITs and emerging markets, using the recent weakness as a selective buying opportunity.</strong></p>

<p>For the month, we increased our exposure to the US consumer discretionary, consumer staples and utilities sectors, and reduced exposure to financials, healthcare, materials and technology sectors. Relative to the S&amp;P 500 sector weights, we remain overweight to utilities, industrials and materials.</p>

<p>October is here, which means winter is coming soon. Now is a good time to weatherproof your home before the weather gets really cold, and it might also make sense to take a similar approach with your investment portfolio.</p>
<p>Just like you want to protect your house from the damaging effects of wind, rain and snow, it can pay to make sure your investments can withstand market turbulence.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40800" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/how-to-weatherproof-your-portfolio.jpg" alt="how-to-weatherproof-your-portfolio" width="450" height="316" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortifying your investments is particularly topical now given the <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/volatility-really-bad-thing-investors">recent pickup in market volatility</a>, and the Federal Reserve beginning to shift away from its easy-money ways.</p>
<p>One more thing. October has a <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/4-things-know-investing-october">reputation for big market crashes</a>, although that certainly doesn’t mean you should sell all your stocks and hide out in cash.</p>
<p>The idea of weatherproofing your portfolio isn’t about making big, wholesale changes.</p>
<p>Rather, long-term investors might want to think about making minor adjustments, such as checking that their portfolio hasn’t gotten out of whack, and making sure they’re not paying too much in fees. We’re talking about cleaning the gutters and putting in storm windows &#8212; not building a new addition.</p>
<p>So, here are 5 sensible steps investors should consider as we finish out 2014:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1) Portfolio rebalancing</strong></h3>
<p>Portfolios have a tendency to drift from their original asset allocations as a result of market moves over time.</p>
<p>For example, now that the U.S. stock market has <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/08/3-things-investors-know-now-market-tripled">climbed 200% since the financial crisis</a>, the percentage of equities in your portfolio may have grown too large for your original risk tolerance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href="http://stocks.covestor.com/spy">SPY</a>)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/spy-sp500-etf.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40803" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/spy-sp500-etf.png" alt="spy-sp500-etf" width="450" height="186" /></a></p>
<p>History shows that investors are usually better off sticking to their original allocation targets. And that’s where <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/07/rebalancing-can-help-protect-portfolio-uncertain-world">portfolio rebalancing</a> comes in.</p>
<p>The idea is periodically trim winning investments, and add to areas of your portfolio that have declined in value. This may seem counterintuitive at first, but rebalancing helps you get back to the asset allocation you initially decided on.</p>
<p>This discipline also helps instill the practice of buying low and selling high, which is the goal of investing, after all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>2) Consider dividends for defense</b></h3>
<p>Owning some high-quality, <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/05/dividend-investing-three-reasons-back">dividend-paying stocks</a> is another time-tested way protect your portfolio.</p>
<p>When markets are flatlining or contracting, dividends can account for a significant portion of a stock&#8217;s<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp"> total return and help cushion the broader portfolio against big losses.</a></p>
<p>Studies have shown that companies with a <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2013/12/dividends-buybacks-stick-worked-2013">long record of paying dividends</a> are often better managed.</p>
<p>And in general, investors tend to favor more conservative, dividend-paying sectors <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/04/best-performing-sector-2014-may-surprise">like utilities</a> in volatile markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>3) Spread it around</b></h3>
<p>One of the key precepts of <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp">modern portfolio theory</a> is to diversify, or spread your investments across several asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that a portfolio drawing from widely divergent asset classes tends to have less price volatility. In other words, as some assets fall in value, others will rise. <i>(See our </i><a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/ultimate-guide-10-used-investing-terms"><i>ultimate guide to investing terms</i></a><i>.)</i></p>
<p>You also want to make sure that no one individual stock gets to be too big a part of your overall portfolio. This reduces the risk of major damage if the company blows up. On top of that, it can make sense to have stock investments that span across different industry sectors, geographies and market capitalizations.</p>
<p>What about bonds? Make sure your fixed income lineup of investments come with varying maturities and different sensitivities to swings in interest rates and inflation rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>4) Dry powder</b></h3>
<p>In an uncertain market, increasing a portfolio’s cash position is worth a serious look.</p>
<p>Covestor manager David Levine, who oversees the <a href="http://covestor.com/david-levine/aspect-large-cap-value">Aspect Large Cap Value Investment portfolio</a>, recently made the case that <b><a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/09/cash">cash actually is an investment.</a></b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40805" src="http://investing.covestor.com/content/2014/10/cash-dry-powder-investing.jpg" alt="cash-dry-powder-investing" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Levine says he uses his cash position to slow down the movement of his portfolio. Cash can soften the blow to a portfolio in a downward market.</p>
<p>On top of that, as Levine sees it, “<b>cash provides optionality, as in the freedom to jump on investing opportunities that might arise.”</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>5) Minimize fees</b></h3>
<p>Investment products and services come with costs and fees. That’s a given. However, investors who fail to keep to track of their fees or look for cheaper alternatives may take a <a href="http://investing.covestor.com/2014/08/stop-paying-fees-keep-more-from-investments">far bigger hit than they imagine</a>.</p>
<p>Fees are like that drafty window that can drive up your heating bills. It doesn’t seem like a big deal, but over time it can really add up.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a recent investment advisory, created three hypothetical portfolios that started with $100,000 and projected them over a 20-year time frame, assuming a 4% annual return.</p>
<p>The twist: Annual fees on the three portfolios varied from 0.25% to 0.50% and 1%. <b>Over two decades, the portfolio with the 0.25% annual fee returned roughly $30,000 more than the one with a 1% fee structure.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Winter isn’t here just yet, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start weatherproofing your home against the elements. <strong>The same idea can apply to your financial portfolio.</strong></p>
